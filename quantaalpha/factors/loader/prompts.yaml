extract_factor_formulation_system: |-
    I have a financial engineering research report and a list of factors extracted from it. I need assistance in extracting specific information based on the report and the provided list of factors. The tasks are as follows:

    1. For each factor, I need its calculation formula in LaTeX format. The variable names within the formulas should not contain spaces; instead, use underscores to connect words. Ensure that the factor names within the formulas are consistent with the ones I've provided.
    2. For each factor formula, provide explanations for the variables and functions used. The explanations should be in English, and the variable and function names should match those used in the formulas.

    Here are the sources of data I have:

    1. Stock Trade Data Table: Contains information on stock trades, including daily open, close, high, low, VWAP prices, volume, and turnover.
    2. Financial Data Table: Contains company financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.
    3. Stock Fundamental Data Table: Contains basic information about stocks, like total shares outstanding, free float shares, industry classification, market classification, etc.
    4. High-Frequency Data: Contains price and volume of each stock at the minute level, including open, close, high, low, volume, and VWAP.

    Please expand the formulation to use the source data I have provided. If the number of factors exceeds the token limit, extract the formulas for as many factors as possible without exceeding the limit. Ensure to avoid syntax errors related to special characters in JSON, especially with backslashes and underscores in LaTeX.

    Provide your analysis in JSON format, using the following schema:
    {
        "factor name 1": {
            "formulation": "latex formulation of factor 1",
            "variables": {
                "variable or function name 1": "description of variable or function 1",
                "variable or function name 2": "description of variable or function 2"
            }
        },
        "factor name 2": {
            "formulation": "latex formulation of factor 2",
            "variables": {
                "variable or function name 1": "description of variable or function 1",
                "variable or function name 2": "description of variable or function 2"
            }

classify_system_chinese: |-
    You are a report classification assistant. The user will input a financial report. A factor is a variable that explains asset returns or prices; a model is an ML/DL model that uses factors to predict price or return.

    Classify the report by two conditions:
        1. It is a stock-selection report in quantitative finance (strictly separate from timing/fund selection);
        2. It covers the construction of factors or models, or tests their performance.
    If both conditions are met, output 1; otherwise output 0.

    Respond in JSON with key: class

classify_system: |-
    Your job is classify whether the user input document is a quantitative investment research report. The user will input a document and you should classify it based on the following conditions:
    1. The document is about finance other than other fields like biology, physics, chemistry, etc.
    2. The document is a research report on stock selection (which needs to be strictly separated from time selection and base selection) in the field of metalworking quantification.
    3. The document involves the composition of factors or models, or tests their performance.

    If the document meets all the above conditions, please return 1; otherwise, please return 0.

    Please respond with your decision in JSON format. Just respond the output json string without any interaction and explanation.
    The JSON schema should include:
    {
        "class": 1
