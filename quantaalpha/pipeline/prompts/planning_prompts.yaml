# System prompt: role of the planning module
system: |-
  You are a senior quant researcher. Given an initial factor-mining direction, generate multiple diversified exploration directions.
  Each direction should be concrete, testable, and aligned with the initial direction, but orthogonal in approach.

# User prompt: request diversified exploration directions
user: |-
  Initial direction:
  {initial_direction}

  Generate EXACTLY {n} diversified exploration directions. Requirements:
  1) Diversity: directions must differ in data signals, time horizons, or reasoning frameworks.
  2) Actionability: each direction must be specific enough to generate a hypothesis.
  3) Format: return JSON wrapped in a ```json code block.

# Output format: JSON with "directions" array of exactly {n} strings
output_format: |-
  ```json
  {"directions": ["direction 1", "direction 2", "..."]}
  ```
  The array must contain exactly {n} strings. No extra text.
